    <h1>Want to learn Object Oriented Programming easily?</h1>
    <h2>You have landed at the right place, in this tutorial we are going to be focusing on teaching basic Java.</h2>
    <p>First, you will need Java installed.</p>
    <p>Before we install Java, we need to make sure you have an IDE, we recommend downloading Visual Studio Code as the IDE, however, you 
        are welcome to use any IDE.
    </p>
    <p>Once your IDE has been downloaded, head on over to this link to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">download Java here.</a>
        Make sure to choose the file that coresponds to your machine, for example, Mac Users need to download the file for a Mac and Windows Users need
        to download the file for Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have downloaded using the link above, make sure to check that it is correctly installed by going to your search bar and looking up
        terminal, and loading up "cmd" after you are in cmd you should be able to search within cmd "java --version" and if it is able to give you
        a java version number you are doing great! However, if it is not able to give you a java version that means you have done something wrong.
        If you are getting the error that says "'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." then please 
        redownload java from the Downlaod java here link. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If Java has been successfully downlaoded then you should be able to load up Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE, and start programming!
        We will need to create a new file and call it "Main.java" and add the following code. 
        <br>public class Main { <br>
            public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                
            }<br>
        }
    </p>

        In java to make a comment you would go to the link and add two forward slashes (//) in front of the line of the code that you have written.
