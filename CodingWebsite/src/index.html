    <h1>Want to learn Object Oriented Programming easily?</h1>
    <h2>You have landed at the right place, in this tutorial we are going to be focusing on teaching basic Java.</h2>
    <p>First, you will need Java installed.</p>
    <p>Before we install Java, we need to make sure you have an IDE, we recommend downloading Visual Studio Code as the IDE, however, you 
        are welcome to use any IDE.
    </p>
    <p>Once your IDE has been downloa   ded, head on over to this link to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">download Java here.</a>
        Make sure to choose the file that coresponds to your machine, for example, Mac Users need to download the file for a Mac and Windows Users need
        to download the file for Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have downloaded using the link above, make sure to check that it is correctly installed by going to your search bar and looking up
        terminal, and loading up "cmd" after you are in cmd you should be able to search within cmd "java --version" and if it is able to give you
        a java version number you are doing great! However, if it is not able to give you a java version that means you have done something wrong.
        If you are getting the error that says "'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." then please 
        redownload java from the Downlaod java here link. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If Java has been successfully downlaoded then you should be able to load up Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE, and start programming!
        We will need to create a new file and call it "Main.java" and add the following code.
        <pre>
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                
            }
        }
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h4>Basics of Object Oriented Programming and Java Syntax</h4>
    <p>
        In java to make a comment you would go to the link and add two forward slashes (//) in front of the line of the code that you have written. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A comment is used for when you are explaining your code. Explaining your code is a crucial part of programming. Many people are unsure of how your
        code works especially if it is someone's first time reading code or doing the code. This is for more clarification with your code whether that is someone
        who does not know much about coding or someone who has been coding for a while. It is equally as important to make sure that your program is filled with
        information to tell you about your code.
    </p>
    <p>
        As talked about previously, having your code commented well throughout can help someone understand it better, in Java this is called JavaDocs. JavaDocs
        are able to be produced by using the /** for the beginning and then **/ at the end indicating that the JavaDocs have started and ended. 
    </p>
    <h5>Your First Java Program!</h5>
    <p>
        Now we will write our first program in java, Hello World. first start by typing <b>public class HelloWorld</b> ending in brackets so that it looks like this:
        <pre>
            public class HelloWorld {

            }
        </pre>
        Then write <b>public static void</b> main(String[] args) followed by brackets once more then writing inside those brackets System.out.println("Hello World!")
        ended with a semicolon.
    </p>
        <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="button1">
            "What it should look like"
        </button>
        <div id="button1" class="collapse">
            <p>
                    public class HelloWorld {
                        public static void main(String[] args){
                            System.out.println("HelloWorld");
                        }
                    }
            </p>
        </div>
