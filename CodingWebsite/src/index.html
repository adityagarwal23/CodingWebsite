    <h2>You have landed at the right place, in this tutorial we are going to be focusing on teaching basic Java.</h2>
    <p>First, you will need Java installed.</p>
    <p>Before we install Java, we need to make sure you have an IDE, we recommend downloading Visual Studio Code as the IDE, however, you 
        are welcome to use any IDE.
    </p>
    <p>Once your IDE has been downloaded, head on over to this link to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">download Java here.</a>
        Make sure to choose the file that coresponds to your machine, for example, Mac Users need to download the file for a Mac and Windows Users need
        to download the fle for Windows.
